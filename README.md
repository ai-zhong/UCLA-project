# UCLA-project
These are the code I wrote in UCLA for processing of soil testings result. It uses ipython widgets to build up the User Interface and used statsmodels (regression) to find key parameters for research purpose. 

The code for triaxial test plotting is published on DesignSafe and can be accessed from this link:https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public/designsafe.storage.published//PRJ-1649, and the Monotonic and Cyclic Plotters are still in progress to publish.
